# Ferrum Network

Ferrum Network enables value, data, and functional interoperability between every blockchain in the industry.
Interoperability by Design.

Ferrum Network's sophisticated solutions simplify the complexity of building a multichain solution and give developers and project owners a single entry point to every recognizable chain and network in the industry. We have thought about the pain points that arise when implementing interoperability as an afterthought in a multi-network / multichain world. 

With an ever-growing list of new EVM and non-EVM compatible chains coming to market, gaining traction, and providing value to segments of the global crypto audience, interoperability has become a core value for most projects. At Ferrum Network, we design from the ground up for interoperability.
